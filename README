Please set up a git hub repo. I have done the leg work all you need to do is add git to your terminal (little bit tricky for MAC) then connect. I already created a project in xcode so just grab it and go. Use the commit string argument to add notes about what you did.

Core Data:

	For this submission I started by creating a Food Object in the core data model view. At this point there is not much information stored in that object but I have sucessfully passed it between views and have only objects in the correct state. 
	STATE 1: Pantry
	STATE 2: Shopping List
	STATE 3: Cart
	STATE 4: 1 & 2
	STATE 5: 2 & 3
	STATE 6: 1 & 3
	STATE 7: 1 & 2 & 3

	We will use this at our state key for all the possible states a food iteam could be in. Review code in the PantryViewController and AppDelegate to see how I have been using core data.
